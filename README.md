# Karen’s Diner — Business Analytics Case Study  

🔍 **Can a novelty-based business survive long-term?**  

This portfolio project analyses the viral restaurant chain **Karen’s Diner**, famous for its rude service concept. While it gained early buzz, my analysis in 2022 forecasted that the model was **unsustainable** — a prediction validated when the diners shut down by 2024–25.  

---

## 📌 Business Problem
Karen’s Diner scaled quickly on the back of a unique customer experience. However, concerns emerged:  
- **Rising costs** (inflation, labour shortages, supply chain pressures)  
- **Shift in consumer behaviour** (towards takeaway/delivery)  
- **Short-lived novelty** (viral hype that fades fast)  
- **Negative sentiment** around food quality and pricing  

The challenge: **Could this model sustain profitability beyond the hype?**

## 🛠️ Methodologies & Tools
I applied a mix of **business analysis and statistical modelling** to test this hypothesis:  

- **Regression Analysis** → Identified drivers of repeat visits  
- **Time-Series Forecasting** → Projected foot traffic trends  
- **Demand Modelling** → Tested pricing sensitivity  
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Extracted insights from customer reviews  
- **Trend Analysis** → Measured novelty fatigue via search interest  
- **Tools Used** → Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Excel

My 2022 forecast projected that **Karen’s Diner would not be sustainable long-term**.  
By 2024–25, this prediction was confirmed as multiple outlets closed and the brand wound down operations.
